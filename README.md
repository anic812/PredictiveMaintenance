# PredictiveMaintenance
This project leverages IBM Cloud and Watson Studio to predict industrial machine failures through a robust machine learning approach.

##  Workflow

- **Data Input**: Uploaded a dataset containing industrial machine sensor readings to IBM Watson Studio.
- **Model Development**: Utilized AutoAI in Watson Studio to automatically generate and evaluate multiple machine learning pipelines.
- **Model Selection**: Identified and selected the pipeline with the highest accuracy for optimal performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Deployed the selected model using IBM Watson Machine Learning for real-time predictions.

**Documentation**: Detailed results, evaluation metrics, and screenshots are available in the `predictive-maintenance-report.pdf`.
